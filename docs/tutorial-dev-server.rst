Using the Remote Settings Dev Server
====================================

Goals
-----

* Create remote records
* Pull them the server


Prerequisites
-------------

This guide assumes you have already installed and set up the following:

- cURL


Introduction
------------

We run a public instance of Kinto, the underlying software of Remote Settings, at https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1

Several authentication options are available. We will use local accounts and Basic Auth for the sake of simplicity.

.. warning::

    Since the server is publicly accessible, we flush its content every day. We thus **recommend you to keep the initialization commands in a small shell script**.


Create your account
-------------------

Let's create a user ``alice`` with password ``w0nd3rl4nd``.

.. code-block:: bash

    SERVER=https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1

    curl -X PUT ${SERVER}/accounts/alice \
         -d '{"data": {"password": "w0nd3rl4nd"}}' \
         -H 'Content-Type:application/json'

When reaching out the server root URL with these credentials you should see a ``user`` entry whose ``id`` field is ``account:alice``.

.. code-block:: bash

    BASIC_AUTH=alice:w0nd3rl4nd

    curl -s ${SERVER}/ -u $BASIC_AUTH | jq .user


Create a collection
-------------------

Choose a name for your settings that makes sense for your use-case and is specific enough (eg. ``focus-search-engines``, not ``search``).

.. code-block:: bash

    CID=focus-search-engines

Using the REST API, we create a collection:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X PUT ${SERVER}/buckets/main/collections/${CID} \
         -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
         -u ${BASIC_AUTH}

We create a simple record for testing purposes:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X POST ${SERVER}/buckets/main/collections/${CID}/records \
         -d '{"data": {"title": "example"}}' \
         -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
         -u ${BASIC_AUTH}

At this point, the server part is ready: it contains a public collection with one record. You can fetch its records with:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl ${SERVER}/buckets/main/collections/${CID}/records

And it should be listed in the monitor/changes endpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl ${SERVER}/buckets/monitor/collections/changes/records


Prepare the client
------------------

The following preferences must be created/changed to the following values in ``about:config``:

* ``services.settings.server`` : ``https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1``
* ``services.settings.verify_signature`` : ``false``

.. important::

    Those are critical preferences, you should use a dedicated Firefox profile for development.


Synchronize manually
--------------------

From your code, or the browser console, register the new collection by listening to the ``sync`` event:

.. code-block:: bash

    const { RemoteSettings } = ChromeUtils.import("resource://services-settings/remote-settings.js", {});

    RemoteSettings("focus-search-engines").on("sync", ({ data }) => {
      // Dump records titles to stdout
      data.current.forEach(r => dump(`${r.title}\n`));
    });

Then force a synchronization manually with:

    RemoteSettings.pollChanges();

.. note::

    Since the developement server is flushed every day, if the client was previously synchronized with data that is not there anymore, the synchronization might fail. You can start from a new profile (``./mach run --temp-profile``) or clear the local state manually (cf. `development docs about local data <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/services/common/services/RemoteSettings.html#manipulate-local-data>`_).


Going further
-------------

Now that your client can pull data from the server, you can proceed with more advanced stuff like:

* `Login on the Admin UI <https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1/admin/>`_ and browse your data
* Create, modify, delete remote records on the server and check out the different ``sync`` event data attributes
* Define a `JSON schema on your collection <http://docs.kinto-storage.org/en/stable/api/1.x/collections.html#collection-json-schema>`_ to validate records and have forms in the Admin UI
* Commit your remote data in Mozilla-Central at ``services/settings/dumps/main/{CID}.json`` in order to have a default dataset for empty profiles
* Attach files to your records (*tutorial coming soon*)
* If you feel ready, try out the STAGE environment with VPN access, multi signoff (see :ref:`tutorial <tutorial-multi-signoff>`), signature verification etc.
